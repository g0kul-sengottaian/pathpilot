# career-guidance-tool

As technology and global keep changing their redefining business environments, excelling in finding a perfect career path is now more crucial than ever. And every Business firms  face crisis to provide opportunities for the rightful and interested skilled leaders with advanced expertise and fresh ideas for success.And as an individual we have been taking suggestions from Elders, Peers and Parents for a long time. Everyone has a different opinion on what we can opt to  pursue and while that is not entirely wrong, the decision might not be as suitable always.  Survey says that 93 per cent of the students were aware of less than ten career options.
In contrast, there are more than 600 career options available today. Therefore, we have come up with a Career Guidance tool using machine learning.So far, only limited research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence to support  career guidance across higher education and working life. This project reports on development on using artificial intelligence to support and further career guidance for a better career path
