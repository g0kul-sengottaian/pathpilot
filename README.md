# career-guidance-tool

As technology and global keep changing their redefining business environments, excelling in finding a perfect career path is now more crucial than ever. And every Business firms  face crisis to provide opportunities for the rightful and interested skilled leaders with advanced expertise and fresh ideas for success.And as an individual we have been taking suggestions from Elders, Peers and Parents for a long time. Everyone has a different opinion on what we can opt to  pursue and while that is not entirely wrong, the decision might not be as suitable always.  Survey says that 93 per cent of the students were aware of less than ten career options.
In contrast, there are more than 600 career options available today. Therefore, we have come up with a Career Guidance tool using machine learning.So far, only limited research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence to support  career guidance across higher education and working life. This project reports on development on using artificial intelligence to support and further career guidance for a better career path

METHODOLOGY:

The main problem in choosing a career is lack of guidance.Our aim is to provide proper guidance in building a suitable career instead of being a copycat. Here we choose machine learning as a tool to reach the young minds.

Data Collection: Gather relevant data from various sources, including job market data, educational information, and career paths. Collect user-specific data such as academic performance, interests, skills, and personal preferences. Ensure that the data is up-to-date and comprehensive. 

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the collected data to handle missing values and outliers. Normalize or scale data to ensure consistency.
Feature engineering and  Machine Learning Model Selection: Create relevant features that can improve model performance. Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms and models for different aspects of the career guidance tool (e.g., recommendation systems, predictive analytics). Experiment with various models and techniques to find the best-performing ones.

Model Training and Validation: Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Train the selected models using the training data. Use the validation set to fine-tune hyperparameters and optimize model performance. Perform cross-validation to ensure robustness. 

UI (User Interface) Design: Develop an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the career guidance tool. Ensure that users can input their information easily and understand the tool's output. Design interactive visualizations to present recommendations effectively. 

Integration with AI/ML Models: Integrate the trained AI/ML models into the user interface. Implement mechanisms to pass user data to the models for analysis and recommendation generation. 

Interfacing using Django : Create user profiles based on the data provided by users. Assess user attributes, such as skills, interests, and career goals, to personalize recommendations. Recommendation Generation utilizes AI/ML models to generate career recommendations, educational paths, or skill development suggestions. Consider incorporating collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and recommendations. Additionally without testing the skills of users a page that provides just information for each field and its respective job roles

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: 
Hence we provide a useful platform for the young engineers to choose fulfilling and meaningful careers that match their personal values and provide satisfaction. 
The tool's recommendations are accurate, as evidenced by high precision, recall, and F1-score. User feedback indicates high satisfaction, highlighting the tool's value in career decision-making. The tool effectively personalized recommendations based on user profiles and goals. Users report making informed career choices with the tool's assistance. The tool addresses ethical concerns, including privacy and bias mitigation.
The AI/ML tool outperforms traditional methods, offering advantages in accuracy and personalization. Acknowledging limitations, such as data availability and model accuracy, while discussing user feedback. Plans for enhancements and adaptability to changing job markets.The tool significantly influences users' career choices and education, bridging the gap between education and industry needs.
